## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- I have written a script in R that allows users to explore bipartite networks. You can find the script on GitHub at this link: https://github.com/hegde-lab/Virus-host-interaction-network.
- Master's Project "Functional annotation and structure prediction of hypothetical proteins in ___Deinococcus radiodurans___ to understand their role in the extreme environment."
- Graduation Project - "Understanding the Genome of Plastic Degrading Bacteria."

- Iâ€™m currently learning ChIP-seq analysis.
- I'm currently working on Epilepsy disease prediction through an EEG report of a patient using ML.
- I'll be happy to collaborate, one can reach me at Surabhi.juli@gmail.com
- Fun fact: I find great joy and tranquility in gazing at flowers and being immersed in their beautiful presence brings me immense happiness.
